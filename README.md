ðŸ‘‹ ì•ˆë…•í•˜ì„¸ìš” (Hello)! I'm @ayandamzolo, a Full-Stack Developer passionate about building robust back-end systems and seamless user experiences. With a background in software development from TUT, specializing in C++, I excel in crafting solutions that combine functionality, performance, and a user-first approach.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm advancing my full-stack skills with hands-on experience in Laravel, Inertia.js, Vue.js, and tools like Redis and AWS. My toolkit includes languages and frameworks like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and C++, as well as databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MinIO. This blend of technologies allows me to deliver comprehensive, high-performing solutions.

ðŸ’» Collaboration is where innovation thrives! From optimizing database performance to implementing intuitive UI and complex back-end logic, I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.
